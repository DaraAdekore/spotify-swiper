# spotify-react

A miniature project made to practice react and the utilization of REST APIs. 
This application while not ready for production by any means is a creative project meant to learn more about the intricacies of React and use the spotify API.

The user is able to search up any song or artist they would like and the application will return the top 50 results that match the query.
