# Getting Started with Swipe with Spotify App

## Disclaimer - This project is functional
It is a personal project so spotify will not approve it for a quota extension.
This means you will not be able to use the app as shown below.
<br>
You are still afforded the ability to clone and insert your own clientID into the application
to regain the expected functionality!

This project was bootstrapped with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/) and [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).
